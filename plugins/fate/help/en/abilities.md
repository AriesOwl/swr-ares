# Fate Abilities

Fate has three kinds of abilities:  Aspects, Skills and Stunts

* Aspects describe important things about your character, including your "High Concept" and "Big Trouble".
* Skills reflect what your character knows and can do.
* Stunts are cool bonuses or tricks your character can do when using skills.

`aspect/add <aspect>` - Adds an aspect.
`aspect/remove <aspect>` - Removes an aspect.

`skills` - Lists skills.
`skill/set <name>=<rating>` - Sets a skill. 
    Any skill not expressly listed is assumed to be Mediocre (+0).
    Set a skill to 0 to remove it.

`stunts` - Lists of pre-approved stunts. Players may also propose new stunts.
    Pages after the first can be read with the command "stunts2" "stunts3" and so on.
`stunt/add <name>[=<description>]` - Sets a stunt.  Description can be omitted for stunts from the sample list.
`stunt/remove <name>` - Removes a stunt.
